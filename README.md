A full-stack internship platform built with a headless architecture using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The backend serves as a decoupled API layer, allowing flexibility for future integration with multiple frontends or third-party systems.

The project features a polished user interface styled with Tailwind CSS and elements from ShadCN. It dynamically fetches data from the backend API, ensuring real-time updates and a seamless user experience.

The application leverages production-ready services like Cloudinary for efficient image management and Redux for state management, ensuring scalability and maintainability. JWT authentication is implemented for secure user access, along with a robust API design to facilitate smooth interactions.

Prioritizing a mobile-first approach, the platform delivers optimal usability across devices. The future scope includes developing a mobile app with React Native to provide a seamless cross-platform experience and further leveraging GraphQL for customizable and efficient queries.
